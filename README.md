# weather-dash

Worked through this Weather Dashboard but had a lot of problems.

Got the API key to work for Open Weather. COuld console.log many of the calls but could not get them to drop into the HTML. When the user searches for the city it appears along with the information in the current weather div. The UV index works but not with the lon and lat needed to retrieve the color block for the index. The console.log will show the history and the forecast but I could not get them to show in the HTML. I tried adding elements for them and that didn't work so I went back to try and make cards to append the information but ran out of time. The weather icon would appear in the current weather div but it was huge and I couldn't get it to resize.

Challenging.
